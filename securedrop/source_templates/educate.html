  <h2>Tips on using SecureDrop</h2>
  <hr class="no-line"/>
</div>

<p>The complete documentation on how to use SecureDrop is provided by the Freedom of the Press Foundation.
  It can be found at <a href="https://docs.securedrop.org/en/stable/source.html" target="_blank">this site</a>, but
  for your convenience, there are a few important things here.</p>

<p>SecureDrop is a Tor Hidden Service which means that we can't identify you by your web traffic, but this protection
  only works while using our service. If you link to external documents or sites such as DropBox or Google Drive, it may
  be possible for us or others to identify you. If you want to upload documents larger than the maximum size, you can
  coordinate with one of the journalists to arrange for a second secure transfer method.</p>
